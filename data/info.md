# Visualization of the magazine "Freiheitskampf"

The newspaper articles are from the Dresden daily newspaper of the NSDAP for the Gau Saxony and cover the years 1930 - 1945.
The articles were taken from the database of the HAIT Dresden. More information about the database and the "Freiheitskampf" can be found [here](http://www.hait.tu-dresden.de/ext/forschung/der-freiheitskampf.asp).
Most of the newspaper articles contain disturbing content. The presentation of this content is for research purposes only.

Note: In the years 1939 to 1942, no articles have been annotated by researchers until now. Furthermore, the article links from 1938 onwards have not yet been made publicly available. However, the articles can be searched manually via the description in the detailed view and the SLUB link.
